# iPoduino

## Main Purpose
![](https://github.com/elizaby3/iPoduino/blob/main/breadboard_diagram.png?raw=true)
The two buttons pause/play/skip songs from the SD card inside of the DFPlayer mini and output the music onto the speaker module in the picture above. Additionally, the buttons are connected to ESP-32 Board with pull up resistors to prevent any unstable input values while the ESP-32 Board communicates with the DFPlayer Mini Module with UART protocol.

The code for the ESP-32 board is inside of the github repository for reference.
